Welcome to Generic Your Way version , 2.0.
This web-site is first way for something biggest in Narrative Warhammer 40k game.
I'm player and big Fun of this system and word .
Really I like this game but sometimes that start borring to play just a matched games.
I speak with a lot of players about that and they also have a same mind like me.
I took something from Warhammer compane rules , something from YouTube gamers that played a narrative games , and that look amazing.
I thought that GW compane not saw playeble now because they have a lot of rules and for that you need a time to understand all moments how to play,
YouTube gameres have something interesting but you haven't got any documents to read and play like them.
I wrote the easy site with a rules a documents with short list rules for How to play and Faction rules which player can download and play.
I hope that you Enjoy to travell whith my site at greate Warhamer System.
