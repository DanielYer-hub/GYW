                        a blocking effect. In other words, if an opponent is on a different height or on the opposite
                        side of the terrain and can see your models, they will be considered eligible for shooting.
                        However, you cannot perform a charge or move through this terrain . Therefore, it can only be bypassed or fly over.</p>
