        <h1>Campaign Rules</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the dark world of Warhammer 40,000. This is a short guide to the campaign. Please read the rules
            for a better understanding of how the campaign will be played. We will try to analyze and explain all the
            points related to it. Please note that this is a (Demo version) of what is yet to be released. Feel free to
            leave your feedback and edits about it, as we are currently working on a more adaptive version for
            smartphones so that in the future you will be even more comfortable playing it and we will make Warhammer
            Narrative Fun Again.

                <h2>Time For Campaign</h2>
                <p>
                    The rules are simple, you create a starting Roster of 1000 pts, choose one detachment to play
                    (note that you cannot change units and detachments, EXCEPT IN SOME CASES WHERE THIS WILL ALREADY
                    BE WRITTEN). You can only add units to your army. After each victory, the player gets +200 pts
                    (maximum 2000 pts and no more). The player who lost gets only +100 pts. All the data 
                    you can write down in the Player Card form. Choose three Planets with roll Dice. Enjoy the game!

                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Only Primary Missions and Deployment from the current Mission Pack by Games Workshop are used
                    in the campaign. Secondary missions are replaced by faction missions that are unique to each army.
                    They are completed instead of regular Secondary Objectives. <br> *(Important: You can use all cards
                    from
                    the current Mission Pack, except Secondary missions).

                <h2>Roster</h2>
                <p>
                    Each player starts with 1000 PTS.You must choose one Detachment and build an army
                    within those points (including Enhancements).Changing the Detachment or army composition during
                    the campaign is not possible, except in special cases.Epic Heroes are prohibited.Instead, you
                    must choose a character (not an Epic Hero) and designate them as your Warlord. You may
                    take multiple characters, but none may have the key-word Epic Hero.These heroes will accompany
                    you throughout the campaign and become part of the narrative.

                <h2>Planets</h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the game you must choose three worlds, for each section
                    roll 1D3 the result on the cube equal to the number written on the planet in the
                    Player Card becomes yours. Circle (1) so as not to forget, you get this bonus for your army or
                    what is written there (you cannot improve the characteristics less than 2+ or a make it worst than
                    6+) At the start of the Campaign, select a world that will be considered Homeland, players do not
                    have the right to capture it until you have only your Homeland left from all available. If
                    you lose a world, then mark (X) and then the bonuses of this world no longer apply to
                    your army. <br>
                    (Important: Before battle from pool of planets which you have, choose just two. You will receive their bonuses
                    for current Battle).

                <h2>Conquest</h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine that you are the conqueror of the sector, the outcome of the duration will take place
                    within a two months, the winner will be the one who has more worlds. Each victory for a planet will
                    include it in the composition of the player who won the battle, the losing player loses this
                    world. When meeting, agree with the player on which world you will attack by rolling 1D6 if the
                    result is +4 then you fight for the world you have chosen if less then you fight for the world
                    that the owner of this world will choose (please note that if you already have one with a
                    certain effect, it cannot be summed up, just add it to the list of available ones below under
                    the name of the world by circling it) this will give you an advantage at the end of the campaign
                    in counting worlds and if suddenly you lose a world with a similar bonus, this will not affect
                    your army in any way. To knock a player out of the company, reset his worlds to the world he has
                    chosen as Homeland by winning two victories in a row. A player who has lost all worlds is
                    eliminated from the campaign. During conquests, a player who has collected 1500 pts receives 1
                    Spaceport at his disposal, and at 2000 pts another one. <br> *(THE SPACEPORT CANNOT BE CAPTURED!).

                <p>
                    When player challeng another player who has more or fewer PTS. <br>
                    For example: <br> 
                    "If player 1 has a maximum of 1500 PTS and he challenges player 2 who has 1300 PTS, 
                    then player number 1 Must decrease his PTS limit to 1300, and rebuild army list from the units he has available.
                    In case when player with 1300 PTS attacks player with 1500 PTS, player with higher PTS limit must do same things, as described above".

                    used (not sports or tournament).This allows for a deeper immersion into the atmosphere of the
                    Warhammer 40,000 world.The basic terrain rules conform to the Core Rules, but with some minor
                    changes.

                This campaign is not just a series of battles, but a journey. The story of your hero, the fate of
                the sector, and the flame of the galaxy all depend on your decisions. Improve your army, choose your
                path, and let the galaxy burn.
