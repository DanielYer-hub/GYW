        <h1>Campaign Story</h1>
        <p>
            A universe where there is only war creates hundreds of reasons for it to begin. The Lacrius System became
            another picture of disaster. Once rich in minerals, it existed untouched for long millennia - until the
            Imperium's war machine came. Worlds began to empty, resources depleted.But the Imperium was not the only one
            who cast their eyes on the paradise worlds. Ever seeking the glory of their Gods, the armies of Chaos
            invaded Lacrius to perform dark rituals in the name of their masters. The Xenos armies followed. Each of the
            aliens sought their own gain: some were eager for battle, while others wanted to recapture virgin worlds to
            settle them.At present, the fate of the Lacrius system is not predetermined, since neither side is going to give up its rights.
